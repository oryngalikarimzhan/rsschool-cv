## Codewars code example:

**Instruction:**
It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
```javascript
function removeChar(str){
 return str.slice(1, -1)
};
```
